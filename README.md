# Overview
- There are four documents in this project, each of which is an independent entity.
- Each new document has undergone functional additions and modifications, and can be regarded as a new version.
- v1.0.0 (the first official version) was released based on the second document because the content of the first document was incomplete.
  Therefore, the first version was named "Automatic Crop Monitoring System 2", and so on:
    the second version (v1.1.0) was named "Automatic Crop Monitoring System-3"; the third version (v1.2.0) was named "Automatic Crop Monitoring System-4".
